    "## What is variance? \n",
    "\t\n",
    "The variance is defined as the average of the square of the difference of each number in the data to the mean of the data. It is denoted as $\\sigma^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__It is a measure that refers to the spread of numbers in a data set.__ A large variance means that the numbers in a set are far from the mean and each other. A small variance means that the numbers are close to the mean and to each other in value. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Another measure of the spread of numbers in a data set is the mean absolute deviation, which you can read about here: [link](https://statistics.laerd.com/statistical-guides/measures-of-spread-absolute-deviation-variance.php)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen $\\sigma$ as the standard deviation of a given dataset: __Variance is simply the square of standard deviation (We could also say standard deviation is the square root of variance)__. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to compute variance\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of a sample of n numbers (for example, the weight of 100 chickens) is calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Taking the differences between each element of the sample and the sample mean, where the sample mean is denoted by $\\mu$, \n",
    "2. Summing together all the squares of the differences \n",
    "3. Dividing the sum by n - 1\n",

    "You may ask yourself why we square the differences when computing variance. If we didn't square the difference of each element in a data set to the mean value of the data, positive and negative differences would cancel each other out when computing the average difference of all the elements in the data set to the mean.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Intepretation of variance \n",
    "\n",
    "* A high variance indicates that the data points are very spread out from the mean, and from one another. \n",

    "* A low variance indicates that the data points are very narrowly spread about the mean, and are close to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A variance of zero indicates that all of the data values are identical. \n",
    "\n",
    "##  Example use case \n",

    "Consider the following graphs for Conglomo, Inc. and Bilco, Inc., two made-up companies.\n",

    "Suppose we collected monthly return data for Conglomo's and Bilco's common stock over several months, and plot the distribution of these values, which turn out to be normally distributed:\n",

    "<img src=\"images/var.png\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Conglomo's distribution of monthly returns is more concentrated around its mean value than Bilco's, as illustrated by Conglomo's relatively narrower bell curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more concentrated distribution has a smaller variance. The distribution curve appears higher, steeper, and narrower because more observations occur close to the expected or mean monthly return. Bilco's distribution is relatively flatter, reflecting that its returns are less concentrated around their mean, or more dispersed, than those of Conglomo Inc.\n",

    "# Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is covariance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance provides an insight into how two variables are __related__ to one another. It refers to the measure of how two random variables in a data set will __change together__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we collect a sample of data of the age and heights of 100 people. Is there a relationship between the height and age of the people in our sample? Are older people taller, and younger people shorter? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to compute covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance of sample of size n of two random variables (for example, the age and heights of 100 people) is calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each variable, taking the differences between each element of the sample and respective variable sample mean,\n",
    "2. Computing the sum of the product of the differences\n",
    "3. Dividing this sum by n - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the covariance between two samples of size n of random variables X and Y is denoted as $\\sigma_{XY}$, as is defined as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\large \\sigma_{XY} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i -\\mu_x)(y_i - \\mu_y)}{n-1}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $X$ and $Y$ are the two samples of random variables of n elements each. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to measure how values in $X$ change with observed changes in $Y$ values, and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, \n",
    "* $x_i$  is the ith element of variable $X$\n",
    "* $y_i$ = ith element of variable $Y$\n",
    "* $n$ = number of data points, where __$n$ must be same for $X$ and $Y$__\n",
    "* $\\mu_x$ = mean of $X$\n",
    "* $\\mu_y$ = mean of $Y$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that if Y = X, then the equation for the covariance is the same as that of the variance. \n",
    "> In other words, the variance of a variable is the covariance of the variable with itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Intepretation of covariance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A positive covariance indicates that higher than average values of one variable tend to pair with higher than average values of the other variable, and lower than average values of one variable tend to pair with lower than average values of the other variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Negative covariance indicates that lower than average values of one variable tend to pair with higher than average values of the other variable, and higher than average values of one variable tend to pair with lower than average values of the other variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If the two random variables are independent from each other,the covariance will be zero. However, __a covariance of zero does not necessarily mean that the variables are independent__. A nonlinear relationship can exist that still would result in a covariance value of zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior can be further explained using the scatter plots below: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/covariance.gif\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "A large negative covariance value show an inverse relationship between values at x and y axes. i.e. y decreases as x increases. This is shown by the scatter plot on the left. The middle scatter plot shows values spread all over the plot, reflecting the fact that variables on x and y axes can not be related in terms of how they vary together. The covariance value for such variables would be very close to zero. In the scatter plot on right, we see a strong relationship between values at x and y axes i.e. y increases as x increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: \n",

    "Let's follow up with the example used in the previous section. \n",
    "\n",

    "We saw how the covariance can identify the degree to which two random variables tend to vary together. \n",
    "\n",
    "In data science practice, we typically to look at the correlation rather than the covariance of two random variables because correlation does not depend on the scale of either random variable involved and is more interpretable as a result. We need to normalize this degree of variation into a standard unit, with results independent of the units of the data. We achieve this with a derived normalized measure, called _correlation_. \n",
    "\n",
    "The __correlation__ between two random variables X and Y is defined as the covariance of X and Y divided by the square root of the product of the standard deviations of $X$ and $Y$. This _normalization_ sets the range of the correlation to lie between the values of -1 to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the correlation between two random variables X and Y is calculated as:\n",

    "Think about stock markets in terms of correlation. Stock market indexes tend to move together in similar directions. When the DOW Jones loses 5%, the S&P 500 usually loses around 5%. When the DOW Jones gains 5%, the S&P 500 usually gains around 5% because they are **highly correlated**.\n",

    "On the other hand, there could also be negative correlation where you might observe that as the DOW Jones loses 5% of it value, Gold might gain 5%. Alternatively, if the Dow Jones gains 5% of its value, Gold may lose 5% of its value. That's a **negative correlation**. \n",

    "Digital publishers want to maximize their understanding of the potential relationship between social media activity and visits to their website. For example, the digital publisher runs the correlation report between hourly Twitter mentions and visits for a two week period. The correlation is found to be r = 0.28, which indicates a medium, positive relationship between Twitter mentions and website visits.\n",

For example, an e-retailer wants to compare a number of secondary success events (e.g., file downloads, product detail page views, internal search click-throughs, etc.) with weekly web revenue. They can quickly identify internal search click-throughs as having the highest correlation, which may indicate an area for optimization.\n",
